      <h2>What is 1+1?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>1+1</strong> is a series of dinners hosted by Annie, Henrik, and
        Cormac. The premise is simple: we started with a seed email list of
        direct friends of ours. Every two weeks, we send out an email and anyone
        interested RSVPs for dinner the upcoming Saturday. The basic catch is
        that they must bring a +1, who will then be added to the email list and
        can come to future dinners. The purpose of <strong>1+1</strong> is
        multifold, but all primarily social. We want interesting people to meet,
        fun conversations to happen, and maybe even friends to be made! We
        believe New York socialization has a fundamental coordination problem;
        the people are here, but it can be frustratingly difficult to branch out
        of your bubble. Our goal with <strong>1+1 </strong>
        is to help address this problem, both for others and ourselves.
      </p>

      <h2>When and where are the dinners?</h2>
      <p>
        With occasional announced exceptions, the dinners will be at{" "}
        <strong>5:30 PM</strong>, every other <strong>Saturday</strong>, at
        Cormac’s apartment in <strong>downtown Brooklyn</strong>. We chose this
        time specifically to give people freedom for late evening plans. More
        than once we’ve had people who meet at dinner end up going out together
        that very evening.

      <h2>What if my +1 flakes?</h2>
      <p>
        New York is New York; people will inevitably flake on you. We don’t hold
        it against you, though we do still expect you to come to dinner. Note
        that if you flake on a dinner you RSVPed to, we will not be happy. It
        goes without saying that life gets in the way of social functions
        sometimes, but please do communicate as much with us.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>I’m struggling to find a +1. Help!</h2>
      <p>
        Finding a +1 can be quite difficult; our rule of thumb is that,
        amortized over all your attendances, you should bring an average of one
        person per dinner. That does imply you can come alone! But do try to
        make up for it and bring multiple people the next time; after all, the
        event fails to achieve its core purpose if new people aren’t coming in.
        Also, remember, you can bring anyone! Sometimes people bring their best
        friends, sometimes they bring someone they just met themselves. Everyone
        is welcome.
      </p>

      <h2>Do the dinners vary? Are there rules I have to follow?</h2>
      <p>
        The general dinner formula tends to be pretty stable, but usually we
        have some conceit that changes the flavor of the evening. Sometimes it’s
        small (e.g. every guest must bring a book of their choice), sometimes
        it’s something bigger (e.g. dinner in Central Park), and sometimes it’s
        even bigger (e.g. you’ll see down the road!). During a given dinner, we
        do ask that you follow the rules the hosts put forth. Rest assured we’ll
        never ask for anything outrageous, but we often have a mechanism in
        place for determining seating and the like.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I bring my significant other?</h2>
      <p>
        For sure, under the condition that they do not count as your +1 for the
        week. We call this the Couple Clause.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>What is the dress code?</h2>
      <p>There isn’t a strict dress code, but we like looking nice!</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Should I bring anything?</h2>
      <p>
        Food and drinks are always appreciated, but certainly not required. Just
        don’t forget to bring your lovely personality! Also, if you want to show
        up early and help cook (or even fully guest chef) please do reach out
        and let us know!

      <h2>Isn't this a pyramid scheme?</h2>
      <p>Yes.</p>
